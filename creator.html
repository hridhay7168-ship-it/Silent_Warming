    Hi, I’m Hridhay Rajkumar, a 14-year-old tech enthusiast with a passion for
    creating meaningful change. I believe technology can be used as a powerful
    tool to spread awareness and inspire action on global issues like climate change.

    I am a keen observer who notices problems around me. One issue that concerns
    me deeply is global warming, a growing threat to our planet that demands
    awareness, responsibility, and action from individuals, communities, and leaders.

  <h2>Why This Project Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Silent warming may not always be obvious, but its impact is serious and long-term.
    Through this project, we aim to raise awareness, encourage responsibility,
    and inspire action to protect our planet for future generations.
